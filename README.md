# Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing
This repo contains code for my experiments in Deep Learning for NLP. Where possible, I'll try to provide a direct link to a Colab Notebook.

## List of Experiments
### Simple LSTM based Language Model with Beam Search
* Contains my implementation of an LSTM based language model with Beam Search (for sentence generation).
